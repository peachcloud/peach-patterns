# peach-patterns

A pattern library for building and maintaining PeachCloud user interfaces.

`index.html` currently serves as the primary aggregator and displayer of patterns in the form of atoms and molecules (see [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) for more information on this approach to building design systems).

`css/css_class_names` contains a simple list of all the custom css class names used in the PeachCloud design system. This list builds on `css/_variables.css`, which contains css variables drawn from the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) library.

`css/peachcloud.css` contains all the custom css class definitions used in the PeachCloud design system.

_Note: This is a work-in-progress._

### Setup

For now you can simply clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the pattern library.
